(** This module generates constraints encoding proprieties of component types (ports they require, provide and conflict) and what bindings can exist between them. *)


(** Name           : All requires of port p must be satisfied. *)
(** Description    : For every component type t which requires port p, all the require ports p of the components of type t must be bound (all the requires must be satisfied). So the total number of ports p required by all the components of type t must be equal to the total number of bindings providing these type of components with port p. *)
(** The constraint : [for each component type t_r which requires port p]  require_arity(t_r,p) x N(t_r) = sum (over all component types t_p from the universe which provide port p) B(t_p,t_r,p) *)
(** Explanation    : N(t) multiplied by number of ports p that a single component of type t requires is equal to the number of all bindings on port p where the component of type t is the requiring one and any other component is providing. *)
val create_require_binding_constraints : universe -> port_name -> cstr list


(** Name           : For every required port p there must exist a provided port p which satisfies that require. *)
(** Description    : For every component type t which provides port p, there cannot exist more bindings providing port p from the components of type t than the total number of ports p they all provide together. So the total number of ports p being provided by all the components of type t must be equal or greater than the number of existing bindings providing port p from components of type t (as each binding corresponds to one port p provided by a certain component). *)
(** The constraint : [for each component type t_p which provides port p]  provide_arity(t_p,p) x N(t_p) = sum (over all t_r from the universe which provide port p) B(t_p,t_r,p) *)
(** Explanation    : N(t) multiplied by number of ports p that a single component of type t provides is equal or greater to the number of all bindings on port p where the component of type t is the providing one and any other component is the requiring one. *)
val create_provide_binding_constraints : universe -> port_name -> cstr list


(** Name           : Unicity of bindings on port p. *)
(** Description    : There cannot be more than one binding on port p between a given component providing port p to another given component which requires port p. *)
(** The constraint : [for each component type t_p which provides port p] [for each component type t_r which requires port p]  B(t_p,t_r,p) <= N(t_p) x N(t_r) *)
(** Explanation    : The number of bindings where a component of type t_1 is providing a component of type t_2 with port p is not bigger than number of components of type t_1 multiplied by number of components of type t_2.*)
val create_binding_unicity_constraints : universe -> port_name -> cstr list


(** Name           : Conflicts on port p. *)
(** Description    : If a component of type t which is in conflict with the port p is present in the configuration, then the total number of ports p provided in the configuration must be equal to the number of ports p which component type t provides. *)
(** The constraint : [for each component type t which conflicts with port p]  ( N(t) >= 1 )  implies  ( N(p) = provide_arity(t,p) ) *)
(** Explanation    : If N(t) is greater than zero, then N(p) must be equal to the number of ports p which t provides. *)
val create_conflict_constraints : universe -> port_name -> cstr list


(** Create all global component type constraints for a given universe. *)
