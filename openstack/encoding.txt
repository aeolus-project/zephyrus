Encoding:

1. REDUNDANCY: Simple / redundant / very redundant

All load balancers are always redundant (i.e. we have two connected redundant copies of each).

- Simple: everything else is required just in arity one.

- Redundant:
3 MySQL backends
3 Keystone backends
2 Glance API backends
2 Glance Registry backends
2 Nova API backends
3 Nova Compute
2 Queue backends

- Very Redundant:
4 MySQL backends
3 Keystone backends
2 Glance API backends
2 Glance Registry backends
2 Nova API backends
2 Nova Schedulers
2 Nova Conductors
4 Nova Compute
2 Queue backends

2. RESOURCE CONSUMPTION: No resources / Big resource consumption for MySQL / High resource consumption for MySQL and Nova Compute / Complicated resource consumption

No resources: simplified, nothing consumes resources.

- Big resource consumption for MySQL:
MySQL-backend consumes 1024 of ram
everything else consumes 128 of ram

- High resource consumption for MySQL and Nova Compute:
MySQL-backend consumes 512 of ram
Nova Compute consumes 1024 of ram
everything else consumes 128 of ram

- Complicated resource consumption:
All Load Balancers consume 64 of ram
MySQL backend consumes 512 of ram
Keystone backend consumes 256 of ram
Glance API backend consumes 256 of ram
Glance Registry backend consumes 256 of ram
Nova API backend consumes 256 of ram
Nova Scheduler consumes 256 of ram
Nova Conductor consumes 256 of ram
Queue backend consumes 512 of ram


3. PACKAGES: Real debian wheezy repository / Artificial simplified repository
(haproxy, keepalived problem, but they are in the same equivalence class, so it's not so bad)

- Real debian wheezy repository:

All component types are implemented by corresponding packages from debian wheezy repository:

All Load Balancers: "haproxy (= 1.4.15-1)"

(A little problem here: 
we should add also "keepalived (= 1:1.2.2-3)", but a component cannot be
implemented by two packages, so we take just "haproxy (= 1.4.15-1)". As these
two packages are in the same equivalence class, so it does not change
coinstallability it's not so bad.)

Mysql-backend: "mysql-server (= 5.5.28+dfsg-1)"

Queue-backend: "rabbitmq-server (= 2.8.4-1)"

Keystone: "keystone (= 2012.1.1-13)"

Glance, Glance-API, Glance-Registry : "glance (= 2012.1.1-4)"

Nova-API, Nova-Scheduler, Nova-Compute: "nova-common (= 2012.1.1-13)"


- Artificial simplified repository:

We use an artificial repository "repository" with just two packages.

All components are implemented by the "common-package".

All Load Balancer components are implemented by the "load-balancer-package".

(This way we have almost the simpliest repository possible and still we
influence Zephyrus to try to collocate Load Balancers (all the "*-LB"
components). Every LB component is inplemented with the "load-balancer-
package" package, so Zephyrus has to install this package every location with
one ore more Load Balancer. As for the final optimization he tries to minimize
the number of packages installed, he will always try to minimize the number of
machines containing a Load Balancer component, therefore he will try to group
these components together.)
