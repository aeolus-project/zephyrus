Encoding:

1. Simple / redundant / very redundant

2. Real wheezy packages / artificial simplified packages
(haproxy, keepalived problem, but they are in the same equivalence class, so it's not so bad)

3. No resource consumption / Big resource consumption for MySQL / High resource consumption for MySQL and Nova Compute / Complicated resource consumption

No consumption:
1. Simple, wheezy
2. Simple, artificial
3. Redundant, wheezy
4. Redundant, artificial
5. Very redundant, wheezy
6. Very redundant, artificial

Big MySQL:
7. Redundant, artificial
8. Very redundant, artificial

High MySQL and Nova Compute:
9. Redundant, artificial

Complicated:
10. Redundant, artificial
