(** This module generates constraints encoding the proprieties of resources. *)

(** The constraint : Resources consumed by components and packages. *)
(** Description    : Resources consumed at a given location (by components and packages) cannot exceed the resources provided by that location. *)
(** The constraint : [for each location l] [for each resource o]  N(l,o) >= ( sum (over all component types t) resource_consumption(t,o) ) + ( sum (over all packages k) resource_consumption(k,o) ) *)
(** Explanation    : N(l,o) must be greater or equal to the sum of resource o consumed by all the components and packages which are installed at that location. *)

(** The constraint : [for each location l] [for each resource o]  N(l,o) >= sum (over all component types t) resource_consumption(t,o) *)

val create_local_component_resource_constraints       : configuration -> universe -> cstr list

(** The constraint : Resources provided by locations. *)
(** Description    : Each location provides a certain amount of each resource. *)
(** The constraint : [for each location l] [for each resource o] O(l,o) = resource_provide_arity(l,o) *)
(** Explanation    : O(l,o) is equal to amount of the resource o provided by the location l. *)
