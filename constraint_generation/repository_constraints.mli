(** This module generates constraints encoding the proprieties of repositories and their packages. *)

(** The constraint : One repository on each location. *)
(** Description    : On each location there must be exactly one repository installed. *)
(** The constraint : [for each location l] ( sum (over all repositories r) R(l,r) ) = 1 *)
(** Explanation    : The sum of all the repositories r installed on a location l must be equal exactly one. *)

(** The constraint : Repository and installed packages. *)
(** Description    : All the packages installed on a location must come from the repository installed on that location. *)
(** The constraint : [for each location l] [for each repository r] [for each package k] ( R(l,r) = 1 )  implies  (if k belongs to r then ( N(l,k) <= 1 ) if it does not then ( N(l,k) = 0 ) *)
(** Explanation    : If R(l,r) is equal to one, then for all the packages k which belong to r, N(l,k) must be smaller or equal to one and for all the packages k which do not belong to r, N(l,k) must be equal to zero. *)
