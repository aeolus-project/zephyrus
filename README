In order to compile the tool simply type "make".

To obtain basic information about using the tool type "./zephyrus -help".

For simple examples of use see files in "tests" subdirectory, especially
all the test scripts "test*.bash".

For several tests based on a more complicated example (the one presented
in the paper), see files in the "example-inputs" subdirectory. Some results
of these tests are available in the "example-results" subdirectory.
