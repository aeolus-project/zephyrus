In order to compile the tool simply type "make".

To obtain basic information about using the tool type "./zephyrus -help".

For simple examples of use see files in "tests" subdirectory, especially
all the test scripts "test*.bash".

For several tests based on a more complicated example (the one presented
in the paper), see files in the "example-inputs" subdirectory. Some results
of these tests are available in the "example-results" subdirectory.

If you want to use the C12 solver:

6. G12 MiniZinc Distribution (version 1.6)

http://www.g12.csse.unimelb.edu.au/minizinc/download.html

You should install it following its installation instructions
and make sure that binaries "mzn2fzn" and "flatzinc" are in
your PATH when you execute Zephyrus.



If you also want to use the GeCode solver:

(you still need C12 installed, because it contains
the mzn2fzn MiniZinc to FlatZinc converter)

7. GeCode

http://www.gecode.org/

Debian package:
flatzinc
